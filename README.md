# Android Return
Here IÂ´m practicing the last technologies that I have worked in HMI Models.

I created a App named Currency Converter.
Nothing special.
However, I destacated, some elements importants for Android, as:

- Activitys
- Fragments
- MVVM Architecture
- Jetpack Compose
- Layouts design
- Kotlin
- Navigation
- Styles
- Themes
